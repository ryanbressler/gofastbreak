This is an experimental to port the fastbreak webservice to go on app
engine. The webservice in question does a traversal of the graph of genetic structural variations
in a tumor sample to produce an adjacency list of the local topology of a given gene which is 
visualized in javascript.

This repo contains a limited javascript ui for testing webservices.

The python on app engine version:
